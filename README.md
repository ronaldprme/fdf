## What I Learned and Why I Loved the FDF Project üó∫Ô∏è‚ú®

### üß† Key Topics and Skills Acquired

- **Fundamentals of 3D Graphics**
  Learned how to represent 3D landscapes using a wireframe model (`fil de fer`), projecting (x, y, z) points into 2D space using **isometric projection**.

- **MiniLibX Library**
  Became familiar with the MiniLibX graphical library ‚Äî managing windows, rendering images, and handling keyboard and mouse events in a low-level C environment.

- **File Parsing and Data Handling**
  Parsed `.fdf` files to extract a 2D matrix of altitudes and translated that data into 3D points for rendering. Applied functions like `get_next_line()` and `ft_split()` from `libft`.

- **Mathematical Transformations**
  Applied geometric concepts (such as rotations, translations, and scaling) to manipulate points and control the 3D view.

- **Graphics Programming in C**
  Gained experience in drawing lines (Bresenham algorithm), handling pixel data, and dealing with performance and rendering optimization.

- **Window & Event Management**
  Ensured clean window behavior ‚Äî responding to close button clicks and `ESC` key presses gracefully.

- **Memory Management and Norm Compliance**
  Practiced careful allocation and deallocation of memory and maintained strict code style and structure according to the school norm.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Why I Loved This Project

- **It Was Visual and Rewarding**
  Seeing a 3D landscape appear in a window that *I* programmed in pure C was deeply satisfying and motivating.

- **It Combined Art and Logic**
  I got to mix creative 3D modeling with precise, technical implementation ‚Äî a perfect balance of math, programming, and visual output.

- **A Gateway into Computer Graphics**
  This project opened the door to deeper exploration of 3D graphics, projections, and even game development.

- **Hands-On Low-Level Learning**
  Everything was built from scratch ‚Äî no frameworks, no external graphics engines ‚Äî just raw C and MiniLibX, which helped me understand what's happening under the hood.

- **Great Foundation for Advanced Projects**
  The knowledge of rendering, user interaction, and data transformation will serve as a strong foundation for future graphical applications.

üß≠ From zero to 3D ‚Äî the **FDF** project taught me how to bring a flat text file to life as a 3D wireframe landscape using pure C. A truly transformative experience!
